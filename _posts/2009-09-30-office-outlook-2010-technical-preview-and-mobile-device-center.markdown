I recently installed Office 2010 TP x64 on a Windows 7 Ultimate x64 PC. After doing this I found my old HP hw6915 Windows Mobile Device would not show any options to sync with Outlook 2010 using the Windows Mobile Device Center. After a little bit of research it turns out that this will not work with the x64 version of Office. After uninstalling the x64 version and installing the x32 version I can now sync again!
