If, like me, you were expecting to find some of the new development features for SharePoint in Beta 1 of Visual Studio 2010 I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed:

<a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enterprise-cms/new-sharepoint-developer-tools-in-visual-studio-2010-004050.php">http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enterprise-cms/new-sharepoint-developer-tools-in-visual-studio-2010-004050.php</a>

It looks like these new features are slated for inclusion in Beta 2 which apparently is going to be "feature complete".

I wonder why it is then that virtually every single article I've read so far on the net about the beta implies that this is a part of it? It just happened to be the main feature I was interested in trying out :-(

Oh well, back to WSPBuilder (which is great anyway) and possibly trying out VSeWSS 1.3 for now until Beta 2...
