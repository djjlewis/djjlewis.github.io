title: Reset to default reader settings in Firefox
---
I'd played around with the spacing and margin sizes in Firefox's Reader mode but wanted to reset to the defaults to see what
they were like. Having found nothing with a quick search, I quickly realised this was likely being set in about:config.
Sure enough, typing reader into the search list showed the modified Reader settings which I could easily reset with a
right-click:
