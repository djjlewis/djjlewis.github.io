title: Productive and efficient Text editing in a Windows VM running on Parallels
  8 / MacBook Pro
---

<p>Even though I have recently taken delivery of a shiny new MacBook pro 15” retina, as a predominately Windows / SharePoint developer, I do find myself inside a Windows virtual machine and / or Windows RDP session for a good part of my working day, currently running under Parallels 8.</p> <p>Also, having cut my web development teeth coding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages">classic ASP</a> in <a href="http://www.textpad.com/">TextPad</a>, I live and die by certain keyboard shortcuts for optional coding productivity. Of course these are not in the league of Vi / Vim shortcuts but good enough for my needs.</p> <p>The main keys (on a standard Windows keyboard) that I use (which I am still amazed by how many developers do not use regularly) are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Home – takes you to the start of the current line.  <li>End – takes you to the end of the current line. (duh)  <li> <li>Shift-Home – Select text from the current cursor position to the start of the current line  <li>Ctrl-Left Arrow / Ctrl-Right Arrow – jump one word </li></ul>
